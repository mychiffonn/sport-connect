## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

It was a pretty smooth process overall and communication throughout the group was nice. We all have a good sense of what we're going to present for the pitch and how to go about it.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We had some challenges with creating the UI design for this initial stage, as well as coming up with and understanding the high-level database table schema

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Since we only have two group members, we may fall into a few challenges when implementing the project.
